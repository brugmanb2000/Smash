# Smash

This is a project for my Systems Programming class where we built our own version of "Bash". While it may not be as in-depth as bash (currently, not able to pipe commands in my version), I have built in I/O Redirects, usage of fork and execvp APIs, and internal commands as well. Works just fine as a normal shell, but may have a little trouble reading crazier commands correctly (i.e. cat >output.txt example.csv) and such. I would like to update this include piping commands down the line, but that may fall to the wayside once my Spring 2020 semester starts. 

### Getting Started

Once downloaded, open up a command line/terminal and change into the directory of the folder. The Makefile should allow for "Make All" to build the project and "Make Clean" to remove the project =)

### Built With

Linux CentOS 7 and coded in C
